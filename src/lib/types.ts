// src/lib/types.ts

// Most type definitions have been moved to:
// - src/domain/entities/
// - src/application/dto/

// Space entity is now imported directly from domain/entities in components that use it.
// This file can be used for any remaining truly generic types
// or UI-specific types that don't fit elsewhere.
// For now, it's kept as a placeholder. If no types remain, it can be deleted.

// Example of a UI-specific type that might remain here or in a component's file:
// export interface ComponentSpecificProps {
//   someProp: string;
// }
